# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tahir Korma!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Science enthusiast passionate about turning data into meaningful insights. I enjoy solving real-world problems using Statistics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Generative AI, and clean code. I have also been exploring LangChain, LangGraph, and Agentic AI to build intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and interact autonomously.
